Implement Algorithm Distillation from the paper [*In Context Reinforcement Learning with Algorithm Distillation*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14215), where a single transformer model is trained to in-context learn the source RL algorithm to solve various RL tasks. The project is implemented on the Darkroom environment.
