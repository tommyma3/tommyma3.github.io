I am a second year Computer Science student at the [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen ([CUHK(SZ)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en)), where I have the privilege of working with [Prof. Chenjun Xiao](https://chenjun-x.github.io/). 

My research interests lie in **reinforcement learning (RL)**. I am passionate about applying modern architectures and algorithms to solve complex decision-making problems and enhance current methods to create generalizable and efficient RL agents.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my work or have any questions:
